# Erection sensor version

Uses AS5311-TS_EK_AB magnetic position sensor. 0.5Âµm resolution.
I purchased a longer magnet strip from aliexpress.

The sensor is sensitive enough to detect heartbeat and provides
more than enough range for clench detection.

It could be utilized for edge-o-matic type functionality
without invasive sensors.
